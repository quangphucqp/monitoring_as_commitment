    <p>Thank you for your participation.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the session in Week 2 has ended but you have not complete the required minimum work. This means that you will only receive the participation fee.</p>
    <p>At the end of next week's session, we will send out an email to all participants where you can provide payment information for bank transfer. The payment will be made in a week afterward.</p>
