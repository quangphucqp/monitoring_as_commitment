<p>Consider the following hypothetical situation.</p>
<p>
Suppose that you win 10 restaurant certificates, each of which can be used (once) to receive a "dream restaurant night" at any restaurant you want, such as
    {{restaurant_name}}. On each such night, you and a companion will get the best table and an unlimited budget for food and drink. There will be no cost to you: all payments, including tips, are part of the prize. The certificates can be used immediately, starting tonight, and it is guaranteed that every restaurant will honor them if they are used within two years. However, any certificates that are not used within this two-year period become valueless.</p>
