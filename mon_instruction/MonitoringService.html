    <p>To help ensure that you meet the deadlines for completing the tasks, you will receive a monitoring service during Week 2 and Week 3. This means that the plan you made in Week 1 will be shared with a monitor, who will track your progress throughout the study.</p>
    <p>On {{ day_in_week }} in Week 2 and Week 3, the monitor will send you reminder messages via Whatsapp when the session is closing yet you have not completed the number of tasks that you initially planned. In addition, at the end of Week 2 session, if you do not meet your plan, the monitor will send you a message via Whatsapp to suggest you work harder in Week 3 so that you can complete all additional work.</p>
    <p>This monitoring service is provided to help you meet the deadlines and ensure that you are able to complete all the necessary work.</p>
    <p>Press "Next" to set up the monitoring service.</p>
